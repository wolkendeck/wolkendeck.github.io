## Core Values

We can help you improving your infrastructure, managing it as code and spreading the Devops culture and principles within your organization through workshops and knowledge sharing sessions

### Sustainability

Our goal is to build solutions that will continue to serve their purpose for years to come. We focus on simple and automated implementations and utilize Open Source technology to prevent vendor lock-in.

### Openness

We don't work behind the scenes. Every step we undertake, to bring your business forward, will be transparent to you. We want you to be fully capable of taking over once our services are no longer needed.

### Continuous learning

We realize that tooling and infrastructure is only one aspect of DevOps. In order to fully utilize the DevOps approach, we see it as one of our core responsibilities to spread the DevOps mindset and continuously educate about the solutions at hand.

### Security

We integrate DevSecOps into your processes and hold top nudge Security as one of our core responsibilities.

### Ready on day one

We have a structured approach to assessing your current situation and will derive a list of action items from this. Once we agree on the prioritization, we will be able to deliver many solutions straight from our existing tool belt.
