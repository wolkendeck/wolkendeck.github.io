## Person 1

Having worked in several Developer roles in the past (Frontend, Game Development and Backend) helped me to create a good understanding of the Development side of things when I moved into Platform Engineering in 2016. I have contributed to several DevOps transformations and Cloud migrations since then. Founding wolkendeck was the next logical step in taking this expertise to a broader application.

### Person 2

Started my career as a Software Engineer working as full stack engineer in the beginning and pivoting to a full backend engineer position after, eventually found my way into infrastructure where platform for applications and code meet, I enjoy since then enabling teams to move faster and better in their goals and the best way to achieve this in my opinion is empowering them with automation and giving them the right tools, wolkendeck mission is to achieve this, spread good practices across organizations improving the landscape of infrastructure across the technology community.
